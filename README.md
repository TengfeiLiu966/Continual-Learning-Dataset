# Continual-Learning-Dataset
Four datasets for continual learning tasks, designed to support incremental and lifelong learning experiments.

This repository contains four datasets designed for **continual learning** tasks. These datasets are curated to support **incremental learning** and **lifelong learning** experiments, helping researchers develop models that can learn new tasks over time without forgetting the previously learned tasks.

The datasets are shared through Google Drive links for easy access and use in research.

## 🗂️ Datasets Overview

### 1. **exAAPD**
- **Description**: We download articles of computer science field from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). For maximizing the diversity of the samples, each month from November 2018 to August 2020 has 3000 articles. After preprocessing, exAAPD contains 49326 structured long documents, which are assigned to one or more of 54 subject categories such as cs.it, cs.cv, cs.cl.
- **Format**: Structured text (JSON).

### 2. **exLitCovid**
- **Description**: The LitCovid is a curated literature hub for tracking up-to-date information about Coronavirus on PubMed Central. The articles are updated daily and categorized into different research topics. We collect 14831 articles from the website and classify them to one or more of the following 8 topics: Prevention, Treatment, Diagnosis, Mechanism, Case Report, Transmission, Forecasting and General.
- **Format**: Structured text (JSON).

### 3. **exMeSH**
- **Description**: We extend the original MeSH dataset to a structured full-text dataset, namely exMeSH, which consists of 15966 academic medical papers with one of 11 top-level disease classes derived from the MeSH vocabulary, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, digestive diseases.
- **Format**: Structured text (JSON).

### 4. **exPFD**
- **Description**: We extend PFD to form exPFD by adding full text and structure information of documents. exPFD contains 24190 training samples, 3023 validation samples and 3023 testing samples, which are assigned to one of 7 fields of geography, politics, economics, business, sociology, medicine and psychology. The numbers of different categories are unequal. For example, psychology has 6.9K documents with 22.6% of all samples, while business has only 6.2%.
- **Format**:Structured text (JSON).
