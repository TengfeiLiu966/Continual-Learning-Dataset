# Continual-Learning-Dataset
Two datasets for continual learning tasks, designed to support incremental and lifelong learning experiments.

This repository contains two datasets designed for **continual learning** tasks. These datasets are curated to support **incremental learning** and **lifelong learning** experiments, helping researchers develop models that can learn new tasks over time without forgetting the previously learned tasks.

The datasets are shared through Google Drive links for easy access and use in research.

## 🗂️ Datasets Overview

### 1. **exAAPD**
- **Description**: A dataset for continual learning based on the **AAPD** task. It consists of images and labels related to the **AAPD** classification task, designed to test a model's ability to incrementally learn new categories over time.
- **Format**: Image data (JPEG/PNG), labels in CSV format.
